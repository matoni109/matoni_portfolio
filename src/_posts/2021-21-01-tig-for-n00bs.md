So you have been using `git log` for a bit to give you a graphical representation of your `git commits` like below, which is great if you have a mad appreciation of [ascii art](https://www.asciiart.eu/), and let's face it when faced with a boring leacture, who didn't get into it at some stage.

```
* | |   cae63d5 - Merge branch 'master' of gitlab.com:gorails/jumpstart-pro (8 months ago) Chris Oliver
|\ \ \
| * \ \   64bd2a1 - Merge branch 'tzdata-gem' into 'master' (8 months ago) Chris Oliver
| |\ \ \
| | * | | ccfdc01 - Rely on tzinfo-data instead of system package (8 months ago) Vlad Gorodetsky
| |/ / /
* / / / 1a96ed5 - Only add sentry-sidekiq if using sidekiq and sentry (8 months ago) Chris Oliver
|/ / /
* | | 0b09656 - Enable TailwindCSS JIT by default (8 months ago) Chris Oliver
```

The important take away here though is that there are tool out there other than ones like [Git Kraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/pricing) which I have used, **but** are not free for private repositorys, which kind of makes them nerfed at 'work' as everything is on a private rep0 ```unless``` they will pay up the ðŸ’µ .

Enter the wonderous world of `tig` which is well and truely worth the price of admission ( it's free ðŸ˜ƒ ), and slide accross the image to see what you get straight out of the box.

- graphical representation of your branches and commits same as `git log`.
- `commit` author, `timestamp` & `git commit` message.
