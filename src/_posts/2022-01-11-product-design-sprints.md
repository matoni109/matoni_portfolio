### Don't Be Evil. Don't Be Building It.

You could argue that something pleasant actually came out of Google after all, in the early days their UX teams were building a lot of product, this mountain of product seems to also correspond with a mountain of abandoned projects, thousands of shredded lines of code, developer hours blown away. In a word "Waste". Something had to be done internally to streamline the proceed and know sooner rather than later if a product idea was going to be a `hit` of a `miss`, and get to that horizon quickly.

### Enter: the Design Sprint

One of the main premisses of the Product Design Spring (PDS),

> Fail fast, fail hard, fail early.!
