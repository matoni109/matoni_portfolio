# Hi there I'm Chris 👋

**About me 🔭**

I'm a 39yo based in Melbourne, originally from Perth 🇦🇺

I have been in the B2B Sales space for 15+ years, which has made me very attentive, understanding to customer needs and adapting in a fast moving environment.

I have always been curious about the tech industry and I recently started my journey in web development with Le Wagon Melbourne: a 24-week part-time coding bootcamp learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript ES6, SQL and Ruby on Rails. Towards the end of the bootcamp I developed with my team a Rails Social-Styled application (www.love-lumina.me) which allows users to connect with like minded individuals in their community through leveraging the Meetup-PRO API.

When I am not coding, I love cycling 🚴, traveling 🌏 and good coffee ☕.

I am currently working in the B2B Sales sector. I am also open to discuss opportunities as a Junior Software Developer, I'm most interested in working in a team environment, striving together to solve problems and learn along the way.

**How to reach me :mailbox:**

I will be very happy to catch up with you around a beer 🍺 or a coffee ☕
